# very-simple-cpu
Very Simple CPU designed by verilog code from the sketch using the binary coding.

By using this VSCPU, implemented a simple memory-mapped system which has access to switches, push buttons, LEDâ€™s on board and also monitor over VGA port of the board.

This project consists of two parts. In the first part, you are going to design VerySimpleCPU and simulate it on PC. In the second part, you are going to use your VerySimpleCPU design to implement a simple memory-mapped system which has access to switches, push buttons, LEDs on the board and also to a monitor over VGA port of the board.
